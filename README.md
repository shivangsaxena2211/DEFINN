 *Where Stocks, Crypto, and UPI meet in one ecosystem.*


## 🚀 Overview

**DEFINN** is a unified financial platform prototype that combines:

- 📈 **Stock Trading**
- 🪙 **Cryptocurrency Trading**
- 💸 **UPI & Digital Wallet Payments**

into a **single, seamless interface**.

The project aims to reduce fragmentation between traditional finance (stocks & UPI) and Web3 (crypto wallets) by allowing users to manage all assets from one dashboard.



## 🧩 Problem Statement

Currently, users manage:
- Stocks on one platform  
- Crypto on another  
- Payments via separate UPI apps  

This leads to:
- Poor fund interoperability
- Manual transfers
- Fragmented user experience

**DEFINN solves this by acting as a bridge between all three.**


## 🧠 Core Modules

> ### Login Page
- Controls user logins and registration
- Also redirects the user if he/she accidently tries to access dashboard
